A full-stack, lead developer with a broad range of technical experience and a record of heading up Agile development teams
through all stages of product delivery, from design and development through to deployment and ongoing maintenance.

I've worked with multiple languages, and in different sectors, from credit card processing in a PCI compliant
environment, to interactive charts to go alongside market analysis reports. You can find more details of my career to
date [in my CV](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/rosshendry).

Currently working as Lead Developer at [KPV LAB](https://www.kpv-lab.co.uk) on a yet-to-be-released project to visualise
and explore data. As well as the development side of things, I'm focusing on improving developer productivity through
applying the principles of devops and CI/CD.

In my spare time I flit between refereeing roller derby, [learning Japanese](https://www.wanikani.com/users/rosshendry),
[tackling the movie backlog](https://letterboxd.com/chooban/films/diary/), and seeing what
[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/chooban) thinks I'd like.
