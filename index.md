A full-stack developer with a broad range of technical expertise, and a record of heading up Agile development teams
through all stages of product delivery. From design and development through to deployment and ongoing maintenance.

I've worked with multiple languages in different sectors, from credit card
processing in a PCI compliant environment, to interactive charts for market
analysis reports. You can find more details of my career to date [in my
CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-hendry-86975120b/).

In my spare time I flit between refereeing roller derby, [learning Japanese](https://www.wanikani.com/users/rosshendry),
[tackling the movie backlog](https://letterboxd.com/chooban/films/diary/), and seeing what
[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/chooban) thinks I'd like.
